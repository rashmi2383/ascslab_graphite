Meeting notes from 2/5/2008
Attendees: Jonathan, Jim, Harshad, Jason

New names for simulator layers:

       User Code
  ====================
     Tile Modeling
  ====================
    Network Modeling
  ====================
   Physical Transport


Performance modeling:
   - Pin may already include functions to count the number of
     instructions executed since the last trap.  Jonathan and Jim will
     investigate.
   - When a message (or messages for an op like a gather) is received,
     the timestamp(s) and the local clock are compared and the local
     clock is updated to the max value.
   - We may need to do periodic synchronization of all threads in
     order to accurately model network contention
     
Goals:
   - March 1, 2008: Complete simulator with simple versions of
     all components     
       - Single-issue, in-order core performance model
       - Magic/bus network model
       - Shared memory physical transport
       - Local caches only
   - End of Spring term: Raw + Shared Memory version of simulator
       - Add dynamic mesh network model
       - Add shared memory and cache coherence
       - Add sockets-based physical transport layer
