This folder is for tests common to all implementations of the simulator. 

Some test style guidelines:
1. Avoid tests which require human interaction if possible. In other words, 
   try to return a boolean which indicates success or failure instead of human
   readable output.
2. If human interaction is needed to verify an output, print the expected 
   output alongside the actual output instead of putting the expected output
   as a comment in the code.
